                    Whiterun is a simple town in the Province of Skyrim.People lead a traditional life and rooted in ancient traditions.
                    The town is surrounded by snowy mountains on all the sides. Legend has it that a fierce dragon resides in the mountains which attacked the town centuries ago
                    and the then King and the soldiers fought well and drove the dragon away into the mountains.
                </p>
                <p>Centuries have the dragon waited seeking revenge and now that the people have forgotten about him and his powers, the time has come.</p>

                    Alduin awakes to the screams of people shouting in the streets. He wondered why. He felt an unusual warmth in his room.Curious as he was, he opened his
                    windows and stared outside. What he saw was shocking. It was flames everywhere. Each and every household was burning.
                </p>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Suddenly he was taken away by the loud roar. He eyes searched for the origin of the roar. It was then he saw the dragon for the first time.An endless
                    revenge took over him. He wanted to destroy the ferocious creature.
                </p>
                <p style="color:white;">
                    He grabbed the sword from his chest, put on his armour and walked outside the door. The dragon was gone back by then.The roar still haunted him.
